Requires Python 3.0 and above
app.py contains the app routes and backend logic for roles and permissions
templates contains the html skeletons for each page
user login information and roles are saved in a local excel table
If setup does not work try replacing the python venv command with python3 instead. (i.e. fist command could python3 -m venv venv instead depending on local python installaition)
Use Setup.bat to install requirements from requirements.txt and run the app
(PS: setup file is geared towards windows systems, please adapt instructions for use in linux and macOS machines)
